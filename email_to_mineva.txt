Dear Mineva,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to let you know that unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to the meeting. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Would you mind sending me the meeting notes afterward? I'd really appreciate staying in the loop. Please keep me updated on what I miss, and I look forward to catching up with you after the meeting.

Best regards,
Joe
